# Lab 02 – Build an autonomous agent to track new files created in OneDrive

**Introduction**

Contoso, a management company has been getting multiple files created in its OneDrive For Business and it has become difficult for the admin to keep track of them as the number of files kept increasing.

**Objective**

Build an autonomous agent to enter the details of the newly added file
to the File Details tracker. This resolves the issue of tracking the
file additions and the File details tracker will have the details of all
the newly created files.

## Exercise 1: Set up the environment

1.  Open a browser and navigate to !!**https://office.com**!!. **Sign
    in** using the credentials from the **Home** tab

2.  Select **OneDrive** from the left menu.

7.  Once the trigger is created, **Time to test your trigger** message
    is displayed. **Close** it. We will tweak the basic flow of the
    trigger a bit to get out functionality implemented and then will
    test it.

### Task 5: Test the trigger

4.  Add few more files similarly.

5.  Now, open the File details.xlsx from OneDrive and observe that the
    details of the files created are added to the tracker.

    ![](./media/image40.png)

6.  When the file is created in OneDrive, the trigger is invoked which
    in turn executes the flow **When a file is added** and updates the
    tracker.

**Summary**

In this lab, we have learnt to create, publish and test an autonomous
agent from Copilot Studio.
